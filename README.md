# Sales prediction using Simple Linear Regression

In this project have used Simple Linear Regression to model the data. 
I have tried to predict 'sales' using the 'amount spent on advertisement using TV as the medium'.

Find the dataset <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VimalChamyal/Advertisement/main/advertising.csv"> here </a>
